# CatalinaLoginWallChanger
This applet will help you install a custom login window wallpaper. This is done by renaming the standard Catalina wallpaper to Catalina-dynamic and replacing it by an image file of your choice.

Note: A side effect of this method is that the chosen wallpaper will also be the default wallpaper for new users.

Use at your own risk. Be sure to have a back-up of your system before proceeding.

Version 1.3, by robni7. See code.txt for the source AppleScript code.

<b>How to use:</b>
